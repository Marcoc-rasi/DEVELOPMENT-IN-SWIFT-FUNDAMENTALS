# DEVELOPMENT-WHIT-SWIFT-FUNDAMENTALS

In this course, I started developing iOS applications with Swift and Xcode. I mastered the basics of the Swift language, the UIKit framework and user interface design. I carried out three projects to practice and test my skills. Unit 1: I became familiar with Swift, Xcode and the Interface Builder, and created a flashlight application. Unit 2: I explored strings, functions, structures, collections, loops and UIKit, and created a guessing game application. Unit 3: I applied navigation, optionals and enumerations, and created a survey that tells you what animal you are depending on your personality.
