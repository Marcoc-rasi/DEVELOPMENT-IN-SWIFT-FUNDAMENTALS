# DEVELOPMENT-WITH-SWIFT-FUNDAMENTALS

In this repository, I started developing iOS applications with Swift and Xcode. I mastered the basics of the Swift language, the UIKit framework and user interface design. I carried out three projects to practice and test my skills. Unit 1: I became familiar with Swift, Xcode and the Interface Builder, and created a flashlight application. Unit 2: I explored strings, functions, structures, collections, loops and UIKit, and created a guessing game application. Unit 3: I applied navigation, optionals and enumerations, and created a survey that tells you what animal you are depending on your personality.
All the exercises correspond to the book "Development with Swift: fundamentals"

# FEATURED APPS

# `Featured Apps`

# `Unit 1 - `First steps in app development`

## Guided Project - `Light`

The App changes the screen from black to white, and vice versa, every time the user touches a button, in this case the entire screen.

# `Unit 2 - Introduction to UIKit`


## `Lesson 2.9. - Controls in Action`

### `Common_imput_controls` - Lesson Application

This iOS app responds to user actions, such as tapping buttons or adjusting controls. Doing so displays informational messages on the console about the switch status, slider value, and other interface events.

## `Lesson 2.10 - Autolayout and Stack Views`

### `Calculator` - Laboratory

The objective of this app is to use Auto Layout to design a view adaptable to the size and design of any screen. View objects, constraints, and stack views will be used to create a simple calculator that preserves its layout across all device sizes.

## Guided Project - `Apple Pie`

This application is a simple word guessing game, where each player has a limited number of attempts to guess the letters of a specific word. With each incorrect answer, an apple falls from a virtual tree. The player's goal is to win by guessing the word correctly before all the apples have fallen from the tree.

# `Unit 3 - Navigation and Workflows`

## `Lesson 3.6 - Navigation Controllers and Transitions`

### `Login` - Laboratory

In summary, the code defines a login view with fields for username and password, and buttons to retrieve the information. Use `performSegue` to handle transitions between views and customize the title of the target view before the transition. The goal is to transfer a username between view controllers and display it on the target screen.

### `TrafficSegues-Marcocrasi` - Lesson Application

In summary, the code relates to an iOS application that uses buttons and a switch (UISwitch) to control transitions between views. The logic in `shouldPerformSegue` determines whether the transition is allowed based on the state of the switch.

## `Lesson 3.7 - Tab Bar Controllers`

### `RainbowTabs-Challenge-Marcocrasi` - Challenged

Modify the tab bar controller to use three navigation controllers as its viewControllers.

## `Lesson 3.8 - View Controller Lifecycle`

### `OrderOfEvents` - Lab

This app provides a hands-on experience with the view controller lifecycle. When developed, messages describing each lifecycle method will be printed to the console when it is called.

## Guided Project - `Personality Questionnaire`

This app guides you through an interactive experience with a series of questions. Collect your answers and determine your personality type based on the option you choose most often. With three view controllers, the user interface dynamically adapts depending on the type of question. This project, under the quiz theme "What Animal Are You?", offers fun results such as dog, cat, rabbit or turtle. The final answer is presented with an emoji of the corresponding animal accompanied by an eloquent and fun phrase.
