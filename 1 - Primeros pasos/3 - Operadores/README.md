# Exploring Operators in Swift

## Description

**Operators** are the symbols that bring your code to life. You will use them to perform actions such as checking, changing, or combining values. There are operators for manipulating numbers and comparing them, for evaluating true and false values, as well as for simplifying conditional assignments, among others.
