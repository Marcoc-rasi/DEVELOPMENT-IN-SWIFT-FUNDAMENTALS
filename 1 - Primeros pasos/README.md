# Unit First steps in app development

This repository covers the "basic concepts" of Swift and introduces you to the creation of modern mobile applications for iOS in the Xcode development environment. It also explores other essential tools and highlights the use of "Interface Builder," a visual tool for designing user interfaces.

Below is a summary of the content, highlighting key parts:

## Swift Lessons
1. **Introduction to Swift and Playgrounds**
2. **Constants, Variables, and Data Types**
3. **Operators**
4. **Control Flow**

## SDK Lessons
1. **Xcode**
2. **How to build, run, and debug an app**
3. **Documentation**
4. **Basic Concepts of Interface Builder**

## Practical Project
- **"Light"** is a full-screen flashlight application.
  - The user can tap the screen to toggle the color between white and black.

With the content in this folder, you will be ready to take your first steps in mobile app development using Swift and Xcode. Best of luck in your learning!

# `Featured Apps`

## `Lesson 1.8 - Interface Builder Basics`

### `InterfaceBuilderBasics` - Laboratory

This code in Xcode controls two buttons in the user interface of an iOS app. Each button has an associated action that modifies the text of a label called mainLabel. One action changes the text to "!This app is great" and the other restores the text to a longer welcome message.

### `IBBasics` - Lesson App

This iOS app in Swift sets up a view with a button called myButton. When button is pressed, prints "The button was pressed" to the console
