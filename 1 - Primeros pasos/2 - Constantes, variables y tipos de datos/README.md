# Constants, Variables, and Data Types

## Description

In the realm of application development and programming in general, the ability to work with data is fundamental. This content focuses on how to handle and store data through clearly defined types in the **Swift** programming language.

## Content

### 1. Constants and Variables

In application development, both *constants* and *variables* play a crucial role in naming and managing data. In this section, you will learn how to:

- Define **constants** for immutable values.
- Define **variables** for values that can change during program execution.

### 2. Data Types in Swift

Data types are essential for modeling and working with information effectively. In this section, we will cover:

- Representation of **numbers**, **strings**, and **boolean values** using native Swift data types.
- Usage and storage of different types in *constants* or *variables*.

### 3. Best Practices in Swift

With the goal of writing clear and secure code, we will explore:

- How to assign values to *constants* and *variables*.
- *Type inference* and how it contributes to cleaner code.
- *Type safety* and its role in creating robust and secure code.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this module, you should be able to:

- Represent **numbers**, **strings**, and **boolean values** effectively in Swift.
- Make informed decisions about the use of *constants* and *variables*.
- Assign values appropriately to *constants* and *variables*.
- Leverage *type inference* to write more concise code.
- Use *type safety* to enhance the integrity and security of the code.
