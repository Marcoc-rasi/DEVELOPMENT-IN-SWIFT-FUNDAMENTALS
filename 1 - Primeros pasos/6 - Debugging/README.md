# Exploring Xcode and Simulator in Swift

## Description

While **Xcode playgrounds** are exceptional tools for learning and experimenting with Swift, Xcode projects are designed for application development. As you write code, it's crucial to see the impact on your application. For this, Xcode provides **Simulator**, an application that allows you to test your applications on various devices and screen sizes, including older ones that may lack recent hardware advances, such as Touch or Face ID, or even the home button removed in the iPhone X.

## Content

### 1. Xcode and Simulator Setup

In this lesson, you will go through the necessary steps to:

- Set up your Mac for **creating and debugging applications**.
- Use **Simulator** to test your applications from Xcode.

### 2. Running on Physical Device

You will learn:

- How to run your application on a **physical device**.

### 3. Debugging with Breakpoints

You will discover how to:

- Perform **basic debugging** using **breakpoints** to locate errors in your code.
