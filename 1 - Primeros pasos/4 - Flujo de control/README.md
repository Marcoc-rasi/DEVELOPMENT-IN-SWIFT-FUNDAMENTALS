# Mastering Control Flow in Swift

## Description

In the previous lesson, "Introduction to Swift and Playgrounds," you understood that a Swift program is developed in a .swift file and executes sequentially, from top to bottom. However, larger applications are more complex; they don't fit in a single file and generally don't execute all lines of code in linear order.

You will learn to write code that makes decisions about which lines should be executed based on previous results. This concept is known as **control flow**.

## Content

### 1. Control Flow Statements

In this lesson, we will delve into the use of logical operators and different control flow statements, such as:

- **if** and **else:** To control which segment of code is executed.
- Logical operators **NOT (!), AND (&&), and OR (||):** To check conditions of truth or falsehood.
- **switch** statement: To make decisions based on multiple cases.
- Ternary conditional operator **(?:):** To conditionally assign values to constants or variables.

## Vocabulary
- `comparison operator`
- `conditional statement`
- `if statement`
- `if-else statement`
- `range matching`
- `logical operators`
- `switch statement`
- `ternary conditional operator`
