# Enumerations

As a programmer, you will deal with many situations that require you to assign values from a limited number of options. Imagine you are writing a program that allows passengers to choose a seat from three options: window, middle, and aisle. In Swift, you would do this with an enumeration.

An enumeration, or `enum`, is a special type in Swift that allows you to represent a set of named options. In this lesson, you will learn when enumerations are commonly used, how to define an enumeration, and how to work with enumerations using switch statements.

## What You Will Learn
- Why enumerations are a useful tool.
- How to define simple enumerations.
- How to define enumerations with raw values.
- How to work with enumerations using switch statements.

### Vocabulary
- `case`: Label used in a switch statement to identify a specific option.
- `default`: Label in a switch statement that is executed when none of the options match.
- `enum`: Keyword used to define an enumeration in Swift.
- `Enumeration`: Data type that represents a set of named options.
