# Tab Bar Controllers

In the last lesson, you learned how to navigate from one view controller to another. However, as you add features to an app, you may realize that going from specific to general and vice versa with a navigation controller is not sufficient. It might be time to level up your view controller hierarchy.
In this lesson, you'll use tab bar controllers to organize different types of information or different operating modes. Tab bar controllers are the key to navigating between view controllers, allowing you to comfortably include more features in a single app.

## What You Will Learn
- How to properly use a tab bar controller.
- How to add a tab bar controller.
