# `TrafficSegues-Marcocrasi` - Lesson Application

In summary, the code relates to an iOS application that uses buttons and a switch (UISwitch) to control transitions between views. The logic in `shouldPerformSegue` determines whether the transition is allowed based on the state of the switch.

The provided code snippet is an implementation of a `View Controller` in Swift, specifically for `iOS` applications. This view controller manages a user interface with two buttons that trigger transitions to other views. Let's analyze it in detail:

A `ViewController` class is defined, inheriting from `UIViewController`. The `UIViewController` class is crucial for controlling a view (screen) in the application.

The `segueSwitch` property is declared, connected to a `UISwitch` via the `@IBOutlet` attribute. This property is linked to a `UISwitch` element in the graphical interface.

The `viewDidLoad` method is automatically called after the view is loaded but doesn't perform any additional actions in this code.

There are two button actions, `yellowButtonTapped` and `greenButtonTapped`, linked to buttons in the user interface. When these buttons are pressed, the code checks whether a transition to another view should be performed, and this check is made by calling `shouldPerformSegue`. If necessary, the transition is carried out.

The `shouldPerformSegue` method is overridden to customize whether a view transition should occur. It takes an identifier and a sender object as parameters and returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`) indicating whether the transition should be allowed.

In this method, it checks whether the sender (which should be a `UISwitch`) is activated (`isOn`). If it is, the transition is allowed (`true`); otherwise, it is blocked (`false`).

In summary, this code is related to an iOS application that uses buttons and a switch (`UISwitch`) to control transitions between views. The logic in `shouldPerformSegue` determines whether the transition is permitted based on the switch's state. The `yellowButtonTapped` and `greenButtonTapped` methods are called when the yellow and green buttons are pressed, respectively, and they rely on the logic of `shouldPerformSegue` to decide whether to perform the transition.
