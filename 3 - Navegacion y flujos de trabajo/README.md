# Navigation and Workflow

After the last two units, you are ready to tackle more complex interfaces and interactions. You've learned the fundamental concepts of Xcode, the development environment for creating iOS applications, and experimented with Interface Builder, a visual tool for designing user interfaces. After creating a basic project, you also delved into the Swift language, understanding programming basics that allowed you to complete the Apple Pie game.

In this unit, you will explore an important feature of Swift for working with optional data. Additionally, you will learn how to use various scenes, views, and controls to create more advanced workflows.

By the end of this unit, you will feel comfortable using Interface Builder and storyboards to build the user interface for applications with multiple views.

## Swift Lessons

- Optionals
- Type Conversion
- Guard
- Scope
- Enumerations

## SDK Lessons

- Navigation Controllers and Transitions
