# Navigation and Workflow

After the last two units, you are ready to tackle more complex interfaces and interactions. You've learned the fundamental concepts of Xcode, the development environment for creating iOS applications, and experimented with Interface Builder, a visual tool for designing user interfaces. After creating a basic project, you also delved into the Swift language, understanding programming basics that allowed you to complete the Apple Pie game.

In this unit, you will explore an important feature of Swift for working with optional data. Additionally, you will learn how to use various scenes, views, and controls to create more advanced workflows.

By the end of this unit, you will feel comfortable using Interface Builder and storyboards to build the user interface for applications with multiple views.

## Swift Lessons

- Optionals
- Type Conversion
- Guard
- Scope
- Enumerations

## SDK Lessons

- Navigation Controllers and Transitions
- Tab Bar Controllers
- View Controller Lifecycle
- Creating Simple Workflows

## What You Will Create

You will create an application called "Quiz," a simple app that guides the user through a personality quiz and displays the results.

# `Featured Apps`

## Guided Project - `Personality Questionnaire`

This app guides you through an interactive experience with a series of questions. Collect your answers and determine your personality type based on the option you choose most often. With three view controllers, the user interface dynamically adapts depending on the type of question. This project, under the quiz theme "What Animal Are You?", offers fun results such as dog, cat, rabbit or turtle. The final answer is presented with an emoji of the corresponding animal accompanied by an eloquent and fun phrase.

# `Unit 3 - Navigation and Workflows`

## `Lesson 3.6 - Navigation Controllers and Transitions`

### `Login` - Laboratory

In summary, the code defines a login view with fields for username and password, and buttons to retrieve the information. Use `performSegue` to handle transitions between views and customize the title of the target view before the transition. The goal is to transfer a username between view controllers and display it on the target screen.

### `TrafficSegues-Marcocrasi` - Lesson Application

In summary, the code relates to an iOS application that uses buttons and a switch (UISwitch) to control transitions between views. The logic in `shouldPerformSegue` determines whether the transition is allowed based on the state of the switch.

## `Lesson 3.7 - Tab Bar Controllers`

### `AboutMe-Marcocrasi` - Laboratory

This app uses a tab bar controller to display various categories of information about you. Each tab represents a different aspect, such as personal data, interests or achievements.

### `RainbowTabs-Marcocrasi` - Lesson App

The application is a tab controller that uses several built-in view controllers to manage different views. Each of these view controllers customizes the behavior and appearance of its associated view. The application consists of at least five of these view controllers, each with a themed name and color.

### `RainbowTabs-Challenge-Marcocrasi` - Challenged

Modify the tab bar controller to use three navigation controllers as its viewControllers.

## `Lesson 3.8 - View Controller Lifecycle`

### `OrderOfEvents` - Lab

This app provides a hands-on experience with the view controller lifecycle. When developed, messages describing each lifecycle method will be printed to the console when it is called.

https://github.com/Marcoc-rasi/DEVELOPMENT-WITH-SWIFT-FUNDAMENTALS/assets/51039101/823aff5b-6f9a-4e99-82ec-a1cdb677575e

### `LifeCycle-Marcocrasi` - Lesson App

This app offers a hands-on dive into the view controller lifecycle. During its development, messages will be printed to the console, describing each lifecycle method when the tab bar controller changes view controllers.
