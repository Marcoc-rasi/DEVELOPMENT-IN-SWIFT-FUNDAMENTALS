# Guard

Most errors reside in complex code. The simpler your code reads, the easier it is to spot potential issues. In this lesson, you'll learn to use `guard` to better manage control flow. You'll learn to handle invalid and special-case values upfront, instead of intertwining them throughout your programming logic.

## What You Will Learn
