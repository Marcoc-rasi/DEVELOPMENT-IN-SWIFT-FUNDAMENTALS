# View Controller Lifecycle

Now that you've learned the basics of Interface Builder, you know that view controllers are the foundation of your app's internal structure. Every app has at least one view controller, and most apps have several.
In this lesson, we'll delve more into the view controller lifecycle so you can understand the potential of this important class.

## What You Will Learn
- Appropriate times to perform tasks in the view controller lifecycle.
- How to add and remove views from the view hierarchy.

### Vocabulary
- `Implementation`: The process of putting something into practice or executing it.
- `Override`: Replacing an existing implementation with a new one.
- `State`: The current condition or situation the view controller is in.
