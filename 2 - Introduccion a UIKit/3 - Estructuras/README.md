# Swift Learning Repository: Structures

## Lesson 3: Creating Custom Data Types with Structures

Swift has many useful types to represent data such as numbers, text, collections, and true or false values. However, as you delve into app development, you'll realize that you want to create your own data types, with properties and functions that you design yourself.

## Highlighted Content

In this commit, you will learn to create custom data types by declaring a `structure`. A structure combines one or more variables into a single type, allowing you to define functions by adding type and instance methods to the structure.

## Key Concepts

### What You Will Learn

- **How to create a custom structure**: Explore the process of defining a new data type.

- **How to define properties of a structure**: Learn to add variables that will be part of your new data type.

- **How to add methods or functions to a structure**: Further customize your structure by including specific functions.

### Important Vocabulary

- `Function`: A block of code that performs a specific task.

- `Initializer`: A special method called when creating an instance of a structure.

- `Initialization`: The process of creating an instance of a structure.

- `Instance Method`: A function that operates on particular instances of a structure.

- `Memberwise Initializer`: An initializer that assigns values to the properties of a structure.

- `Method`: A function associated with a structure.

- `Property`: A variable that belongs to a structure.

- `Self`: A reference to the current instance of a structure within its methods.

- `Structure`: A data type that combines variables into a single type.
