# Swift Learning Repository: Classes and Inheritance

## Lesson 4: Managing Data and Advanced Functionality with Classes and Inheritance

You have learned about `structures` as a way to gather data and functionality into a type. Many programming languages also support another feature, called `classes`, which serves a similar purpose. For special cases, classes can (and should) be used instead of structures.

Classes and structures are very similar, and you can use either as the foundation of your program or app. In this commit, you will learn the differences between classes and structures and when to use classes instead of structures. Additionally, you will delve into the concept of `inheritance`, superclasses, and subclasses.

## Key Concepts

### What You Will Learn

- The differences between a structure and a class: Understand the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

- How to define a class: Learn to create your own class and assign properties and methods to it.

- The concept of inheritance and its relevance: Explore how to share functionality between classes through inheritance.

- How to write a class that inherits from another class: Create a subclass that leverages the functionality of a base class.

- How to use a class to manage complex states in an application: Discover how classes can facilitate handling more complex states.

### Important Vocabulary

- `Base Class`: A class used as a foundation for other classes.

- `Class`: A programming structure that can contain data and functions.

- `Inheritance`: The process by which a class acquires properties and methods from another class.

- `State`: The current condition or values of an application at a given moment.

- `Subclass`: A class that inherits from another class and can extend or override its functionality.

- `Superclass`: The class from which a subclass inherits functionality.
