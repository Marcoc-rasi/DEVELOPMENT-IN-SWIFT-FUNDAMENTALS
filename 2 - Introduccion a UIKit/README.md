## Unit 2: Introduction to UIKit

In the last commit, you started to delve into the **basics of the Swift programming language** and the **Xcode** development environment. You explored aspects such as `constants`, `variables`, `types`, `operators` and the `flow of control`. You also had the opportunity to experiment with some key features of Xcode.

## Changes in this Commit

In this commit, you will take it a step further. You will learn about `structures`, `collections`, `cycles` and various strategies for managing information in an application.

### Featured

- **Structures**: Dive into creating and effectively using structures to organize your code.

- **Collections**: Discover how to work with `arrays`, `dictionaries` and other collections to manage data sets.

- **Loops**: Master `for` and `while` loops to control the flow of execution in your programs.

- **Large Project**: At the end of this unit, you will be faced with creating a significant project. Don't worry if it seems challenging, because it is! Every programmer in the world has overcome similar challenges.
