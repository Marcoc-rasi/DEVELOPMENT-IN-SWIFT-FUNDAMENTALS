# Swift Learning Repository: Loops

## Lesson 6: Automating Tasks with Loops in Swift

You probably encounter many everyday tasks that you keep doing until a certain condition is met. You might keep filling a water bottle until it's full or keep performing a task until it's complete. Scenarios that involve the repetition and completion of a task can be achieved in programming through `loops`. In this commit, you will learn how to create loops in Swift, control loop execution conditions, and specify when they should stop.

## Key Concepts

### What You Will Learn

- How to iterate through each value of a collection using a "for" loop: Explore the "for-in" control flow structure.

- How to iterate through a range of values: Learn to use the `closed range operator` for iterations.

- How to write a loop that continues until a condition becomes false: Introduction to the `repeat-while loop` and `while loop`.

### Important Vocabulary

- `Closed Range Operator`: An operator that creates a range including all values from the first to the last.

- `For-In Loop`: A control flow structure used to iterate over all elements of a sequence.

- `Half-Open Range Operator`: An operator that creates a range including the first value but excluding the last.

- `Iteration`: The process of repeating a sequence of instructions.

- `Repeat-While Loop`: A loop that executes a code block repeatedly until an exit condition becomes false.

- `While Loop`: A loop that executes a code block as long as an entry condition is true.
