An application called "MiAppHola" has been created using Xcode. This application features a user interface consisting of text labels and an image of Rick and Morty. The text labels were used to display personal information such as the name and a brief description. The appearance of the interface elements, including font size and colors, was customized to suit preferences.

An application has been created that showcases the pastime of watching the series "Rick and Morty." Within the application, six images from the series are featured alongside descriptive labels that explain the reasons for its appeal. The interface design is attractive and tailored to reflect the creator's enthusiasm for the series. The purpose of the application is to share the love for "Rick and Morty" and provide a brief introduction to the series for other fans or potential new followers.
