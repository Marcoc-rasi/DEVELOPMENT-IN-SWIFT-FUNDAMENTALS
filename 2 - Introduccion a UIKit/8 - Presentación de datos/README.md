# Data Presentation

In the last lesson, you gained knowledge about common views and controls. Now, you will put that knowledge into practice.
In this lesson, you will use Interface Builder to take the first steps in creating an app called "Hello," which you can use for self-introduction. You will plan the content of the app and add labels and a profile image to start building it.
