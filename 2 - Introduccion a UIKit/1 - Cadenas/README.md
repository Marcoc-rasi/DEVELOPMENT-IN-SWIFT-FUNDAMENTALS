# Swift Learning Repository: Strings

## Lesson 1: String Manipulation

In this commit, we will dive into the fascinating world of **strings** in Swift. Text is omnipresent in our daily lives: on signs, social media, bills, and cereal boxes. It's not surprising that text manipulation is as crucial in programming as in any other context.

## Highlighted Content

In this lesson, you will learn to create and store text using the `String` data type. We will explore a variety of `String` methods that will allow you to:

- **Declare a String type** : Learn how to create and assign values to `String` type variables.

- **Compare two strings** : Discover how to evaluate equality or difference between two strings.

- **Access particular characters in a string** : Explore methods for working with specific characters within a string.

## Key Concepts

### Important Vocabulary

- **Case sensitivity** : Understand the difference between uppercase and lowercase letters in strings.

- **Concatenation** : Combine or join multiple strings into one.

- **Equality** : Evaluate whether two strings are equal.

- **Escape character** : Use special characters to represent non-printable formats.

- **Index** : The position of a character within a string.

- **Literal** : Direct representation of a value in the code.

- **Range** : A sequence of consecutive values.

- **String interpolation** : Incorporate variable values into a string.

- **Substring** : Extract a portion of a string.

- **Unicode** : Character encoding system that includes symbols, letters, and numbers from different languages.
