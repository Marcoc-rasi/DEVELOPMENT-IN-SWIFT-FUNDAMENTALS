# Swift Learning Repository: Collections

## Lesson 5: Efficient Work with Data Sets in Swift

Up to this **commit**, you have learned to work with individual elements, whether constants or variables. However, sometimes you will find that it makes more sense to work with a group of objects as a whole. A `collection` allows you to reference multiple objects at once. For example, you could handle a dozen eggs using a constant instead of managing twelve separate constants. In this **commit**, you will learn about the various types of collections available in Swift and how to choose the right one for your program.

## Key Concepts

### What You Will Learn

- How to declare collections of constants and variables: Explore the creation of data sets in Swift.

- How to add and remove values from arrays and dictionaries: Learn to dynamically manipulate data in your collections.

- How to choose the appropriate collection type: Understand the differences between `arrays` and `dictionaries` and when to use each.

### Important Vocabulary

- `Array`: An ordered collection of elements.

- `Dictionary`: An unordered collection of key-value pairs.
