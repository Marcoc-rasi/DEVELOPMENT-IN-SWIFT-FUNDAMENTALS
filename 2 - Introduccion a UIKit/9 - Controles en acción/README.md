# Controls in Action

Two lessons ago, you learned about common views and controls. In the last lesson, you had the opportunity to practice creating labels and image views. Now, you can take it a step further by setting up controls and control event responses.

In this lesson, you will use Interface Builder to add buttons, switches, and sliders to a scene. You will also create actions and outlets, write basic code, and understand how these tools work together.

## Highlighted Content

- How to use a button to execute code.

- How to use a switch and access its value.

- How to use a slider and access its value.

- How to use a text field and access its value.

- How to respond to user interactions with gesture recognizers.

- How to connect controls to actions programmatically.

### Vocabulary

- **`gesture recognizer`**: A component that identifies and responds to gestures made by the user, such as taps or swipes.
