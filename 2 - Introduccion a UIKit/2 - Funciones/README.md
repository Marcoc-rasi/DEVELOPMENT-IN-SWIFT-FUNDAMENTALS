# Swift Learning Repository: Functions

## Lesson 2: Creating and Using Custom Functions

In previous lessons, you became familiar with the use of existing functions, such as `print`, to perform specific tasks. In those cases, you didn't need to worry about the details of the function's implementation; it simply worked. However, if you aspire to write code that is maintainable and reusable, you'll need the ability to create your own functions.

## Highlighted Content

In this commit, you will learn to declare functions with different parameters and `return` types. At the same time, you'll understand the importance of abstraction in programming.

## Key Concepts

### What You Will Learn

- **How to write your own functions**, whether with or without a `return` type.

- **How to specify input parameters** to customize functions according to your needs.

- **How to return multiple values** when necessary.

- **How to customize function calls** to fit into your code.

- **How to provide default parameter values** for greater flexibility.

### Important Vocabulary

- **Argument Label**: Name used when calling a function to specify the value of a parameter.

- **Parameter**: Variables used to accept input data in a function.

- **Return Type**: The data type that a function returns as a result.

- **Returned Value**: The result that a function produces as output.
