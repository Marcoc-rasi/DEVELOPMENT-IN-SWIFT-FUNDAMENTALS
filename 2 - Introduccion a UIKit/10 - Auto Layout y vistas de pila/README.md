# Auto Layout and Stack Views

When creating an application, it is crucial to ensure that it looks good on all iOS devices. Xcode includes an advanced system called Auto Layout that makes it easy to build complex interfaces that work on various screen sizes.
Auto Layout relies on constraints or rules to dynamically calculate the size and position of all views in a view hierarchy. This way, your interfaces will look and function the same, regardless of the device users have in their hands or how they hold it.
In this lesson, you will learn the basics of Auto Layout to create user interfaces with precise layouts.

### Vocabulary

- **`Auto Layout`**: A design system that enables the creation of flexible interfaces that adapt to different screen sizes.

- **`constraint`**: A rule that defines the relationship between the visual properties of views.

- **`same level`**: View or element that shares a similar relative position in the interface.

- **`size class`**: A category describing the available dimensions on a device.

- **`stack view`**: An organization of views that allows for the automatic distribution and stacking of elements based on established constraints.

# `AutoLayoutPractice` - Lesson Application

The objective of this app is to use Auto Layout in 5 labels to design a view adaptable to the size, orientation and layout of any screen.

# `Calculator` - Laboratory

The objective of this app is to use Auto Layout to design a view adaptable to the size and design of any screen. View objects, constraints, and stack views will be used to create a simple calculator that preserves its layout across all device sizes.
