# Introduction to UIKit

When using electronic devices, you realize the importance of the user interface. In the development of your own applications for iOS, you will heavily rely on `UIKit`, a fundamental framework for creating and managing user interfaces (UI). UIKit defines how information is presented to the user, how to respond to system interactions and events, as well as the manipulation of animations, text, and images. Virtually any visual element you see on an iOS device has probably been created with UIKit.

In this lesson, we will explore some of the most commonly used interface elements in UIKit and provide you with additional information.
